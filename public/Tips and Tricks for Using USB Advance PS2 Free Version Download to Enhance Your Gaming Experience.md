If you have a PlayStation 2 console and a USB hard drive, you might be interested in playing your PS2 games from the hard drive instead of using discs. This can save you time, space and money, as well as protect your discs from scratches. However, not all PS2 games are compatible with this method, and some may have issues with loading or sound. In this article, we will show you how to use USB Advance, a free homebrew program that allows you to play PS2 games from a USB hard drive.
 
## What You Need
 
- A PlayStation 2 console (any model except SCPH-9000x)
- A USB hard drive formatted to FAT32 (up to 2TB)
- A USB cable to connect the hard drive to the PS2
- A way to boot homebrew on your PS2 (such as Free McBoot, Swap Magic or a modchip)
- A PC with a DVD drive and a software to rip PS2 games (such as DVD Decrypter or ImgBurn)
- USB Advance ELF file (available at [^1^])
- USBUtil 2.0 software (available at [^2^])

## Step 1: Rip Your PS2 Games
 
The first step is to rip your PS2 games from the discs to ISO files on your PC. You can use any software that can create ISO files from DVDs, such as DVD Decrypter or ImgBurn. Make sure you select the correct mode and settings for ripping PS2 games. For example, in DVD Decrypter, you need to choose Mode > ISO > Read and select the destination folder for the ISO file. In ImgBurn, you need to choose Create image file from disc and select the source and destination for the ISO file.

Once you have ripped your PS2 games to ISO files, you need to rename them according to the game ID. The game ID is a four-letter code that identifies the game region and version. You can find it on the disc label or on the spine of the case. For example, the game ID for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (PAL) is SLES\_525.41. You need to rename the ISO file to this code followed by .iso extension. For example, SLES\_525.41.iso.
 
## Step 2: Transfer Your PS2 Games to the USB Hard Drive
 
The next step is to transfer your PS2 games from the PC to the USB hard drive. You cannot simply copy and paste the ISO files to the hard drive, as they need to be converted and split into smaller files that can be read by USB Advance. To do this, you need to use USBUtil 2.0 software, which is a utility that can manage and patch PS2 games for USB loading.
 
To use USBUtil 2.0, you need to run it as administrator and select your language. Then, you need to choose File > Create game from ISO and select the source ISO file and the destination folder on your USB hard drive. You can also choose a name for the game folder and enable or disable some options such as compression or patching. Click Start and wait for the process to finish.
 
Repeat this step for each PS2 game you want to transfer to the USB hard drive. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive, as each game can take up several gigabytes.
 
## Step 3: Boot USB Advance on Your PS2
 
The final step is to boot USB Advance on your PS2 and play your games from the USB hard drive. To do this, you need to have a way to boot homebrew on your PS2, such as Free McBoot, Swap Magic or a modchip. If you don't have any of these methods, you can check out some tutorials online on how to install them.
