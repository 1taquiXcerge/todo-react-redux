Console commands are special codes that you can type in the game's console to activate different effects and functions. For example, you can use console commands to change the difficulty level, enable cheats, unlock items, and more. However, console commands are not officially supported by the developers and may cause bugs or glitches in the game. Use them at your own risk and discretion.
