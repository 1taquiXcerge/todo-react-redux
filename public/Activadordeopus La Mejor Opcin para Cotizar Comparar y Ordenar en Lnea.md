## History and Impact of Marathi Vishwakosh
 
The idea of creating a Marathi encyclopedia was first proposed by Dr. R. V. Paranjpe, a renowned mathematician and educationist, in 1938. He envisioned a comprehensive and authoritative source of knowledge in Marathi that would cater to the needs of students, teachers, researchers and general readers. He also suggested that the project should be funded and supported by the government and the public.

However, due to various reasons, such as lack of funds, political turmoil, World War II and partition of India, the project could not take off for many years. It was finally revived in 1960 by the newly formed state of Maharashtra, under the leadership of Chief Minister Yashwantrao Chavan and Education Minister R. R. Diwakar. They appointed a committee headed by Tarkateertha Lakshman Shastri Joshi, a distinguished scholar and linguist, to oversee the project. Joshi became the first president and editor-in-chief of the Marathi Vishwakosh Nirmiti Mandal (Marathi Encyclopedia Creation Society), which was registered as a public trust in 1964.
 
The Mandal adopted a scientific and systematic approach to create the encyclopedia. It divided the topics into various categories and subcategories, assigned them to experts from different fields, collected and verified the information, edited and formatted the articles, and published them in volumes. The first volume of Marathi Vishwakosh was released in 1976 by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The last volume was published in 2010, completing 18 volumes with about 25,000 articles and 12,000 illustrations.
 
The Marathi Vishwakosh has been widely acclaimed as a monumental achievement in the field of Marathi literature and culture. It has been praised for its accuracy, clarity, comprehensiveness and relevance. It has also been recognized as a valuable resource for preserving and promoting the rich heritage of Maharashtra and India. It has been used by students, teachers, researchers, writers, journalists and general readers for various purposes. It has also inspired the creation of other regional language encyclopedias in India.
